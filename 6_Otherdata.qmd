## Census

There are many websites that provide a version of census data. However, it can be challenging to link census data (often a table) to some spatial data (e.g. village or districts)

Census data that i have found:

* [Indian census tables](https://censusindia.gov.in/census.website/data/census-tables)
  * Note, that from my understanding Telangana was separated from Andhra Pradesh in 2014. This means that the census data here will probably not reflect current boundaries. This is not a *major* issue we just need to ensure that it is reflected in any proposed analysis.
  
* [Indian Census data on Kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/india-census?select=india-districts-census-2011.csv)
  * This is not specific to Hyderabad

## Earth observation data  

This is beyond the scope of the workshop but if you are interested explore the [Google Earth Engine data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets)
