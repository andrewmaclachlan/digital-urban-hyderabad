    "text": "1.2 Projections\nSpatial data is special as it must have a coordinate reference system (CRS) often referred to as a projection.\nThese are mathematical formulas that specify how our data is represented on a map. &gt; How would you represent the globe on a 2D paper map, screen or sphere?\nProjections can either be geographic coordinate reference systems or projected coordinate reference systems. The former treats data as a sphere and the latter as a flat object. You might come across phrases such as a resolution of 5 minutes or a resolution of 30 metres, which can be used to establish what kind of projection system has been used. Let me explain…\nA minute type of resolution (e.g. 5 minute resolution) is a geographic reference system that treats the globe as if it was a sphere divided into 360 equal parts called degrees (which are angular units). Each degree has 60 minutes and each minute has 60 seconds. Arc-seconds of latitude (horizontal lines in the globe figure below) remain almost constant whilst arc-seconds of longitude (vertical lines in the globe figure below) decrease in a trigonometric cosine-based fashion as you move towards the Earth’s poles.\n\n\n\nLatitude and Longitude. Source: ThoughtCo.\n\n\nThis causes problems as you increase or decrease latitude the longitudinal lengths alter…For example at the equator (0°, such as Quito) a degree is 111.3 km whereas at 60° (such as Saint Petersburg) a degree is 55.80 km…\nIn contrast a projected coordinate system is defined on a flat, two-dimensional plane (through projecting a spheroid onto a 2D surface) giving it constant lengths, angles and are…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Illustration of vector (point) data in which location of London (the red X) is represented with reference to an origin (the blue circle). The left plot (a) represents a geographic CRS with an origin at 0° longitude and latitude. The right plot (b) represents a projected CRS with an origin located in the sea west of the South West Peninsula. Source: Lovelace et al. (2019) section 2.2\n\n\nKnowing this, if we want to conduct analysis locally (e.g. at a national level) or use metric (e.g. kilometres) measurements we need to be able to change the projection of our data or “reproject” it. Most countries and even states have their own projected coordinate reference system such as British National Grid in the above example…Note how the origin (0,0) is has moved from the centre of the Earth to the bottom South West corner of the UK, which has now been ironed (or flattened) out."

In response they have developed a standard zone called a shrid that keeps the boundaries the same across all census years!

    "text": "3.4 Adding spatial data\nYou will be presented with a blank map. To assist us in navigating on the top tool bar select Web &gt; Quick Map Services &gt; OSM &gt; OSM standard\nThis will provide us with a “basemap” it is actually the same as OpenStreetMap but the features are not queryable and it is just an image.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s add some data. To add a spatial layer (e.g. a shapefile) you can simply drag and drop it into QGIS.\nNote that a shapefile is composed of a variety of files! See the explaination of shapefiles\nFor the purpose of this workshop select the .shp and drag it in.\nIn a similar theme we can also drag and drop in a KML file. Here, i have add the point of interest layer from the OpenStreetMap data (that i downloaded) and the schools data (KML) from Open Data City. Note that we can see the files in the layer tab on the left. If we uncheck a box the layer is removed from the map.\nWe can also right click a layer and zoom to layer to see the full extent of it (here, all the points).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Setting a cordiante reference system\nThere are two coordinate reference systems to be aware of:\n\nThat of each data layer\nThat of the “map layer” or the “canvas” in QGIS.\n\n\n3.4.1.1 CRS of data\nEach spatial layer will have a coordinate reference system. If we right click on the point of interest layer from OSM &gt; properties &gt; information. We can see that the CRS is EPSG:4326 - WGS84.\n\nIf we do the same for the school data (from Open Data City) we get the same CRS.\nThis is a geographic CRS and we can see that the units are in degrees - so not very helpful if we want to work out distance!\nTo transform the CRS to something more use (in metric units) we can use the reproject layer function.\nFirst, make sure the processing toolbox is on the screen. Processing &gt; Toolbox. The processing tool should appear. Search for Reproject layer. A good one for Hyderabad is 32644.\nFor this example i have transformed:\n\nThe sub districts\nThe OSM points\nThe Open Data City schools\n\n\n\n3.4.1.2 CRS of the map\nIn the bottom right corner of QGIS you will see an EPSG for the map - mine is 4326. QGIS sets this based on the first dataset loaded.\nIf a new dataset is loaded that is different you will get a warning. But QGIS reproejcts on the fly this means that any new data will be shown as if it is in the map CRS.\nNevertheless we should always reproject our data before analysis to a local CRS!\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Adding csv point data\nIf we had a csv file with latitude and longitude as points we can add this as a spatial layer through the data source manager.\n\n\n3.4.3 Adding raster data\nFor raster data we can drag and drop it again! For example download the worldpop 2020 estiamtes for India\nThen drag and drop!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many ways we can use / extract data from a raster file. This is beyond the workshop. But we can convert this to vector (points or polygons) and reproject it if needed."

We want to select features from the points layer (here the open street maps points) by comparing them to the boundary of the Hyderabad sub districts.\nYou can select what operator to use, intersects is typically the default in most spatial applications..\nOnce this has been run the points within the boundary are selected.
